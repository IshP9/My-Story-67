There was a place called Araudon, in which evil and good people lived together. It was peaceful as always, the sky had a bueatiful sunset,
there were beaches that people visited often. Things were going perfectly fine until a Dragon appeared. No one had expected this beast, to appear 
out of nowhere, they had never seen a creature like this. Many of the people in the town where Dragon appeared ran into their homes,
hoping for it to leave them alone. Onlu two people remained. They were the Evil Witch and the Queen.
